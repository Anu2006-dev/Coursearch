# Coursearch

### this project's end result is a course searching engine. if google is information search engine this is a course search engine.
for now this will only search for courses in worlds most popular course sites such as udemy, lynda, skillshare(this search engine is mainly optimized for developers). and I hope to extend this for others too. My Backend is Django and frontend is react. elasticsearch is used for searching purposes and backend and the front end communicate via a rest framework.
