# Suggest Course

### this project's end result is a search engine. if google is information search engine this is a course search engine.
for now this will only search for courses in worlds most popular course sites such as udemy, coursera, lynda, skillshare, 
brilliant. (this search engine is mainly optimized for developers). and I hope to extend this for others too. so there a 
lot that can be improved such as Search Engine Optimization giving filtering options. for now I just building the most 
simple version which is just searching for courses.
